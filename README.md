Hi, I'm Mafixdeveloping, aka Rombot Dev.
I'm a 9th-grade student from Germany, and I'm always open to collaborating!
I’ve been working with Python since 4th grade, and I’m currently learning C.
I’ve already built a few websites using Flask.
If you're interested in working together, we can use the Discussions section of a repo. (Privacy is very important to me.)
